# Anesthesia Duration Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the upper bound of potential anesthesia duration for surgical operations. The predictions are integrated into the Mediflow app calendar to assist in operation scheduling and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

The anesthesia duration prediction model is designed to estimate the maximum likely duration of anesthesia for various surgical procedures. By providing an upper bound estimate, it helps medical staff and administrators to:

1. Efficiently schedule surgeries
2. Allocate resources more effectively
3. Improve patient care by reducing delays and cancellations

The model's predictions are integrated into the Mediflow app calendar, allowing for seamless incorporation of these estimates into the hospital's workflow management system.

## Repository Structure

The repository has a simple structure:

- `README.md`: This file, containing project documentation.
- `requirements_training.txt`: Specifies the Python packages and their versions required for the project.


4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements_training.txt
   ```


## Integration with Mediflow App Calendar

The predictions generated by this model are designed to be integrated into the Mediflow app calendar. The integration process involves:

1. Generating predictions for upcoming surgeries
2. Formatting the predictions to match the Mediflow app's data structure
3. Sending the formatted predictions to the Mediflow app's API

For specific details on how to integrate with the Mediflow app, please refer to the Mediflow API documentation.
